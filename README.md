# Arduino_LED_instrument
A small project for wappu2022 Teekkaritorvet concert. The idea is to create interactive LED-lights for various brass instruments.

The preliminary working principle of the product is to detect sound from an instrument and activate a random color for the duration of the sound.

Components:

Arduino UNO
LEDS: WS2812B
Microphone: MAX9814
1000uF capacitor
1kohm resistor


To do:
1. Test USB powerbank for lighting the LEDS
2. Create an eagle schematic and circuit board + manufacturing
3. Solder the heck out of everything
4. Test the treshold values with euphonium
5. ????????
6. Profit
